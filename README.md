# harebrain
An early, incomplete, possibly somewhat broken version of fastai for Swift for Tensorflow.

The Harebrain library is working on v0.4.

You can download and train [imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette/) by typing `swift run` at the root of this repo. First you'll need to install Swift for Tensorflow (currently works with 0.4.0).
